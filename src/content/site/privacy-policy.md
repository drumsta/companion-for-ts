## Your privacy

No personal details are asked - your privacy is important. However, to ensure a better service, some of your personal settings are stored to the browser's local storage, e.g. selected rolling stock class, max speed or speed units. All stored data is kept locally in your browser only and never transferred to any third parties.

## The use of cookies

Your visit to this website is anonymous as no tracking, marketing, or any other commercial cookies are used.

## Monitoring and analytics

Currently no monitoring or analytics services are in place. However, at some point the one might be employed to get visibility of how many visits the site gets. In the case of such an event, it will be a privacy-focused analytics tool that stores no cookies and is fully GDPR, CCPA and PECR compliant.
