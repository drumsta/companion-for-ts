## Philosophy

Driving a train is a responsible task and you should avoid any unnecessary risks. However, we all are humans - sometimes you might forget what the current speed limit is, sometimes you might want to track stations or towns along the way if you're new to the route, or just quickly check what the train start procedure is.

Companion for Train Simulator strives to be your little cab budy, silently sitting beside and giving a helping hand when you need it.
