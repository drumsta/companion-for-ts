# Please see the documentation for all configuration options:
# https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-code-owners

# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most precedence.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo.
# Unless a later match takes precedence, these will be requested for review when someone opens a pull request.
